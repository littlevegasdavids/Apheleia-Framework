# 🛍️ Shop Emporium 🛍️
Shop Emporium is an ecommerce website for the vintage, thrift and antique store [Emporium Curiosity](https://www.instagram.com/emporiumofcuriosity/)

Currently live for demo purposes: https://shopemporium.co.za/

## ❓ Problem ❓
Starting an ecommerce website for a small business is expensive. Platforms like [WooCommmerce](https://woocommerce.com/) & [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) provide a lot of the box functionality & tools to create, run and manage your ecommerce website. However these platforms are expensive with different tiers encouraging the business owner to spend more money on higher tiers or on tools provided by the platform. 

Over all the costs are padded up and will end up with the business owner paying $100 - $200 per month.

## ✅ Solution ✅
I created my own ecommerce platform named "Apheleia" (The goddess of simplicity) from scratch with the basic functionality to run a quick and efficient ecommerce website. These functions include and are not limited to cart functionality and management of products and orders through a dashboard interface.

The final product of what you see today is something I am very proud of. The website loads content and responds quickly which creates an amazing end user experience compared to deploying a website to Shopify or Woocommerce which only gives you more traffic bandwith if your website generates more traffic.

## 📚 What I learnt 📚
The platform took me 3 months to create. It taught me a lot about creating a full-stack web app with the creative frontend and the modular approach to the backend structure, both aspects of coding that I love to implement. 

I learnt the power of using database triggers, compressing images to ensure that they loaded quickly from a web browser and managing user sessions.

Lastly, it gave me the confidence I needed to show myself that I am capable of creating one of the hardest things to code from scratch.
